# A Brief History of AI

> With a respectful nod to [Professor Stephen Hawking](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbm.2019.0001), as this title is inspired by his [A Brief History of Time](https://www.fisica.net/relatividade/stephen_hawking_a_brief_history_of_time.pdf) [masterpiece](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time).

Let's start with a simple two-slide brief history of AI. (Find the PowerPoint deck [here](./ABriefSlideshow.pptx).) A narrative follows.

Some academics got together in 1956 when John McCarthy organized the Dartmouth Summer Research Project, where he coined the term "artificial intelligence." AI as a formal field of study is born.

In 1958, McCarthy created the LISP ("LISt Processing") programming language which could be used to hand-code rule-base systems. LISP was used to create the first notable AI project, ELIZA (an AI psychoanalyst) in the 1960s, and later expert systems in the 1980s. None of these changed the world.

Approaching the turn of the century, machine learning emerged. ML does not use hand-coded rules but rather is powered by statistical analysis and thrives on large amounts of training data. Neural Networks (NN) are a specific subfield of ML.

A big early ML "win" was IBM's Deep Blue defeating chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.

In the 2010s deep learning and neural networks took off, inspired by AlexNet's eye-popping performance in the 2012 ImageNet competition.

The transformer architecture showed up in 2017 and revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), leading to models like BERT and GPT.

In late Nov 2022, ChatGPT burst onto the scene, exposing conversational AI to the world. ChatGPT was trained on the corpus of data available on the Internet. No Internet, no ChatGPT.

With LLMs now widely available via an API or a download, suddenly programmers can perform feats never before possible.

* Create poetry
* Summarize a document
* Write code
* Find errors

And generally draw on the corpus of common human knowledge.

Today Gen AI (based on LLMs) is a subfield of ML which is a subfield of old school AI. (See slide.)
